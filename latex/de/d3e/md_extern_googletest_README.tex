This subdirectory holds instructions for building \href{https://github.com/google/googletest}{\texttt{ Google\+Test}} as part of this project. This is meant to come in handy for building the project\textquotesingle{}s tests in environments which do not provide Google\+Test themselves.

Note that since Google\+Test is only needed for the unit tests of this project, which are not installed together with the project, Google\+Test is not installed together with the project either.
